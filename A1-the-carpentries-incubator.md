# The Carpentries Incubator

## Topic Tags

Lessons under community development in the Carpentries Incubator are
[listed on The Carpentries website][community-lessons],
based on metadata describing the lesson.
This metadata is added in the form of topic tags on the lesson repository.
Some of these topic tags are essential, while others are more flexible.
See the table below for guidance about the types and number of topic tags each
lesson repository should have.

| Category | Example | Number | Description |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Lesson* | `lesson` | 1 | Must be `lesson` to be listed on the Community Developed Lessons page. |
| Location* | `carpentries-incubator` | 1 | `carpentries-incubator` or `carpentrieslab`. |
| Language* | `espaÃ±ol` | >0 | The language(s) the lesson is available in. |
| Stage* | `alpha` | 1 | The current development stage for the lesson. Read on for more info. |
| Domain | `microbial-ecology` | 1-2 | The high-level domain(s) of the lesson, for a general categorization. |
| Tools | `python` | 1-3 | The main tool(s) taught in the lesson. |
| Skills | `taxonomic-classification` | 1-3 | The main skill(s) taught in the lesson. |

*Categories marked with an asterisk (\*) are required in order for a lesson to appear and be appropriately sorted on the Community Developed Lessons page.*

The Curriculum Team will support you in setting appropriate topic tags for your lesson.
To help ensure consistency across all lesson repositories
developed by The Carpentires community,
please refer to [this listing][incubator-topics] of topic tags currently
in use in The Carpentries Incubator,
and re-use these values where appropriate,
creating new topic tags where no pre-existing label exists for your lesson.
